:: To do list ::
1. Markers with labels and picture of the person when clicked.
2. Add the slider that will be used to move the timeline.  (Use a Jquery Slider to do this and this slider will not be a part of map)

:: Possible Concerns ::
1.  Logging in with facebook leads a issue, what if the same user is logging in with different mobile devices -> this will spoil all the tracking thing.

Tasks that are Done : 
1.  Managing huge amount of markers with markers clusters.    // Done
2.  Google Maps = Drag and Zoom !    // Done
3.  Incorporate some jquery.   // Done
